# K2.SOFT BANK PROJECT

# This small console application project is based on the question description below.

QUESTIONS:
# The ATM machine of K2. SOFT Bank, contains biometric security features, besides conventional PIN control. The customers of K2. SOFT bank have the choice either to use CARD + PIN or CARD + BIOMETRIC options. Customers from other banks can also withdraw cash from K2. SOFT bank ATM: However, they can only use CARD +PIN option.

# Customer CARD is captured by the machine after 3 conservative unsuccessful attempt.

# Work: Draw a flow chard and prepare a C program, implementing the process of cash withdrawer from K2. SOFT bank system. Your application should do the following:

# Task 0: Enable customers of K2.SOFT bank and others to do withdrawer 


# NB:
# 1. The card code during login is a substitute for the real world card insert into ATM machine

# 2. The BANK_CODE "K2" which is used to verify if the card belongs to the back or not is a substitute for a real world ATM card verification

# RUNNING THE APPLICATION

# To run this application on Linux (Ubuntu) terminal, type:
# 1-> g++ main.cpp Entities/cAccount.cpp Entities/cCard.cpp Entities/cCustomer.cpp -o main
# 2-> ./main

# Since I did this on ubuntu, I can only provide a clue on it.
